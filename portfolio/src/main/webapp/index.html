        <div><p>My name is Tianan Li, from the School of Software of Tsinghua University. I am currently in the second year of a graduate student. My major is software engineering, and my research direction is database kernel R&D. Undergraduate studies in communications engineering at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My native place is Anhui. I grew up in Tianjin since I was a child, so I'm named Tianan. My name has nothing to do with Tian'anmen Square, it is just a coincidence.</p></div>

        <p>Apache IoTDB is the only Apache project in China’s universities. It is a timeseries database for industrial Internet independently developed by Tsinghua University. IoTDB(Internet of Things Database) is an integrated data management engine designed for timeseries data, which can provide users specific services for data collection, storage and analysis. Due to its light weight structure, high performance and usable features together with its intense integration with Hadoop and Spark ecology, IoTDB meets the requirements of massive dataset storage, high-speed data input and complex data analysis in the IoT industrial field.</p>
        <h3>Main Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One of Apache IoTDB founding team core members and PPMC members, responsible for the kernel development. Independently developed the synchronization module, dynamic parameter adjustment module, memory estimation tool, etc; Participate in refactoring the write engine and building the Apache IoTDB website.</li>
            <li>The head of the Apace IoTDB distributed version development team. Designed and implemented a distributed timeseries database framework based on Raft protocol and consistent hashing. Designed and implemented distributed metadata management, writing, and query modules. Contributed more than 50% of the codes.</li>
            <li>Maintain the open-source community ecology, introduce Apache IoTDB and discuss the deployment of Apache IoTDB with multiple enterprises.</li>
